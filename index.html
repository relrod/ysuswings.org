      <h2>Learn.</h2>
      <p>
        At the beginning of each meeting, we provide a lesson structured
        such that members with all levels of dance experience will come
        away with new knowledge. Whether it's your first time dancing or
        you've been dancing for years, you are sure to pick up something
        new.

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2>Practice.</h2>
      <p>
        After the lesson, each meeting features social dancing where you can
        put everything you just learned into practice. Get out on the dance
        floor and have a great time swing dancing with fellow students.
      </p>

      <h2>Grow.</h2>
      <p>
        We encourage all members to share feedback with each other during
        the social dance portion of our meetings. Through practicing and
        communicating with your fellow students, you will grow as a dancer.
