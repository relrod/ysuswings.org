# DJing Our Weekly Dance

If you are interested in becoming a DJ, please provide Ricky Elrod with a
30-minute proposed set-list. Feedback will be sent back and if all parties
wish to go forward, a 30-minute trial slot will be scheduled for an upcoming
dance.

# Some Guidelines on Music Selection

- Play music that you have danced to before. Seriously: If you're not sure
  about a tune, play it on your computer and dance to it in your house before
  you DJ it at a social dance.

- We want to promote all different forms of *swing* dancing, and as such we
  encourage our DJs to, in addition to reading the crowd and keeping the energy
  level appropriate, mix in music that accommodates all different kinds of
  swing dances including (but not limited to) Lindy Hop, East Coast, Balboa,
  Charleston, and Shag.

- We encourage DJs to play music that has a *swung rhythm*. This excludes most
  Latin songs as well as most electro-swing songs. We are primarily a swing
  dance club and there are other clubs which provide other forms of dancing.

- Consider the length of your songs. Most dancers in a social dance setting
  would rather dance with 4, 3-minute dances with different people than 2,
  6-minute dances in the same twelve minutes. There is no hard and fast rule
  here, but generally if a song is much longer than around 3.5 minutes, you
  should probably think hard before playing it.

- With each song, ask yourself what you expect people to dance to it, and see
  if they are following your expectations. This gives some indication about how
  well you are reading your crowd.
